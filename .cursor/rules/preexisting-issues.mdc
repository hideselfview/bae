# Pre-existing Issues

**Do not attempt to fix pre-existing linter errors, compiler warnings, or test failures that are unrelated to the current work.**

When you encounter errors from `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, or tests:
1. Determine if the error is in code you just modified or created
2. If the error exists in untouched code from before the session, ignore it
3. Only fix errors that you introduced in the current session
