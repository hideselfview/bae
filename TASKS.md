# bae Implementation Progress

> [!NOTE]  
> bae has moved beyond **pre-implementation** and now has a working core system!
> We have a functional album import workflow with encrypted chunk storage.
> Our current focus is expanding functionality while keeping these things out of scope:
>
> - Scanning or monitoring files for changes
> - Checking disk space
> - Thinking about exclusive disk access
> - Permissions
> - Error handling/unhappy paths
> - Health monitoring, monitoring in general, statistics
> - Key rotation
> - Retry mechanisms
> - Caching, prefetching, optimization

## âœ… Currently Working Features

**Complete Album Import Pipeline:**
- Search Discogs for albums (masters and releases)
- Select local folder with audio files  
- Real-time import with progress tracking
- Automatic file-to-track mapping
- AES-256-GCM encryption of all chunks
- SQLite database storage of metadata
- Secure key management via system keyring

**What happens when you import an album:**
1. Search Discogs API for album metadata
2. Select local folder containing music files
3. Create album/track records in SQLite database
4. Split each audio file into 1MB encrypted chunks
5. Store chunk metadata with integrity checksums
6. Files are now ready for cloud storage upload
