# Progress Service Refactor - COMPLETED

## Problem
Current implementation uses polling (`try_recv()` in loops) in multiple components with 100-500ms intervals, which is inefficient and messy.

## Solution: Centralized State with Smart Refresh

### Architecture

**ProgressService** - Internal to ImportService, maintains shared progress state

**Key Components:**
1. Thread-safe state storage: `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<...>>>`
2. Single background thread - Blocks on channel `recv()`, updates state
3. Components read state via `progress_service.get_album_progress()`
4. Smart refresh: Only polls every 2 seconds, only when imports are active

### How It Works

```
ImportService ---channel---> ProgressService(state) <---read--- Components
                 (blocking)     (Arc<RwLock>)              (smart refresh)
```

1. **ImportService** sends progress over channel
2. **ProgressService** background thread does blocking `recv()` (NO tight polling loop)
3. Updates thread-safe HashMap when messages arrive
4. **Components** read from HashMap, triggering automatic re-renders
5. **Library** component refreshes every 2s when imports are active (much more reasonable than 100-500ms)

### Benefits

- **Centralized state** - Single source of truth for all progress
- **Thread-safe** - Uses Arc<RwLock> for safe concurrent access
- **Efficient** - Blocking channel recv + smart 2s refresh (not 100-500ms tight loops)
- **Simple** - Components just read state, no complex subscription management
- **Works with Dioxus** - No fighting the framework's threading model

### Changes Made

#### ProgressService (src/progress_service.rs)
- Stores progress in `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<...>>>`
- Background thread blocks on `progress_rx.recv()`
- Provides `get_album_progress()` and `get_track_status()` for reading state

#### ImportServiceHandle (src/import_service.rs)
- Removed `try_recv_progress()`, `get_import_state()`, internal state tracking
- Added `progress_service()` getter to access ProgressService

#### Components
- **library.rs**: Removed 500ms polling loop, added smart 2s refresh when imports active
- **album_detail.rs**: Removed 200ms polling loop
- **import_workflow.rs**: Removed 100ms polling loop, navigate to library after import starts
- **AlbumCard**: Reads progress directly from ProgressService (no subscription complexity)

### Migration Summary

- Deleted old polling loops from 3 components
- Replaced with single smart refresh (2s interval, only when needed)
- Centralized all progress state in ProgressService
- Reduced from 3 polling loops (100-500ms) to 1 smart refresh (2s)
- Much cleaner and more efficient!
