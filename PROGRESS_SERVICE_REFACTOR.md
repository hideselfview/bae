# Progress Service Refactor - COMPLETED

## Problem
Current implementation uses polling (`try_recv()` in loops) in multiple components with 100-500ms intervals, which is inefficient and messy.

## Solution: True Event-Driven Subscriptions

### Architecture

**ProgressService** - Broadcasts progress updates via async channels

**Key Components:**
1. Tokio broadcast channel for publish-subscribe pattern
2. Single background thread - Blocks on `recv()`, broadcasts messages
3. Components subscribe via `subscribe_album()` and await messages
4. **ZERO POLLING** - Components block on `rx.recv().await`

### How It Works

```
ImportService ---channel---> ProgressService ---broadcast---> Components
                 (blocking)                   (pub/sub)       (await)
```

1. **ImportService** sends progress over std::mpsc channel
2. **ProgressService** background thread blocks on `recv()`, broadcasts immediately
3. **Components** subscribe and `await rx.recv()` - blocks until message arrives
4. Signal updates trigger automatic re-renders
5. **NO POLLING ANYWHERE**

### Benefits

- **True event-driven** - Messages push to subscribers instantly
- **Zero polling** - Components await on async channel, no loops
- **Efficient** - Only active when messages arrive
- **Clean** - Simple pub/sub pattern with tokio broadcast
- **Works with Dioxus** - Subscribers run on Dioxus async runtime

### Changes Made

#### ProgressService (src/progress_service.rs)
- Uses `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel for pub/sub
- Background thread blocks on `progress_rx.recv()` and broadcasts
- Provides `subscribe_album()` returning async receiver
- **NO state storage** - pure message broadcast

#### ImportServiceHandle (src/import_service.rs)
- Removed `try_recv_progress()`, `get_import_state()`, `ImportState`, `ImportStatus`
- Added `progress_service()` getter to access ProgressService

#### Components
- **library.rs**: Removed 500ms polling loop entirely
- **album_detail.rs**: Removed 200ms polling loop
- **import_workflow.rs**: Removed 100ms polling loop, navigate to library after import starts
- **AlbumCard**: Subscribes via `subscribe_album()`, awaits on `rx.recv()` - **ZERO POLLING!**

### Migration Summary

- Deleted ALL polling loops (100-500ms intervals)
- Replaced with true async subscriptions via broadcast channels
- Components await on receivers, update signals when messages arrive
- Instant updates when progress changes, no delays
- Much cleaner, more efficient, and truly reactive!
